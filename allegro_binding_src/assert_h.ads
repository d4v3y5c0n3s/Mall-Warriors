  -- void assert (int expression);
  --   If NDEBUG is defined, do nothing.
  --   If not, and EXPRESSION is zero, print an error message and abort.   

  -- void assert_perror (int errnum);
  --   If NDEBUG is defined, do nothing.  If not, and ERRNUM is not zero, print an
  --   error message with the error text for ERRNUM and abort.
  --   (This is a GNU extension.)  

  -- This prints an "Assertion failed" message and aborts.   
   --  skipped func __assert_fail

  -- Likewise, but prints the error text for ERRNUM.   
   --  skipped func __assert_perror_fail

  -- The following is not at all used here but needed for standard
  --   compliance.   

   --  skipped func __assert

  -- When possible, define assert so that it does not add extra
  --   parentheses around EXPR.  Otherwise, those added parentheses would
  --   suppress warnings we'd expect to be detected by gcc's -Wparentheses.   

  -- The first occurrence of EXPR is not evaluated due to the sizeof,
  --   but will trigger any pedantic warnings masked by the __extension__
  --   for the second occurrence.  The ternary operator is required to
  --   support function pointers and bit fields in this context, and to
  --   suppress the evaluation of variable length arrays.   

  -- Version 2.4 and later of GCC define a magical variable `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__'
  --   which contains the name of the function currently being defined.
  --   This is broken in G++ before version 2.6.
  --   C9x has a similar variable called __func__, but prefer the GCC one since
  --   it demangles C++ function names.
